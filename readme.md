Scriban is a fast, powerful, safe and lightweight scripting language and engine for .NET, which was primarily developed for text templating with a compatibility mode for parsing `liquid` templates.

Today, not only Scriban can be used in text templating scenarios, but also can be integrated as a **general scripting engine**: For example, Scriban is at the core of the scripting engine for [kalk](https://github.com/xoofx/kalk), a command line calculator application for developers.

```C#
// Parse a scriban template
var template = Template.Parse("Hello {{name}}!");
var result = template.Render(new { Name = "World" }); // => "Hello World!" 
```

Parse a Liquid template using the Liquid language:

```C#
// Parse a liquid template
var template = Template.ParseLiquid("Hello {{name}}!");
var result = template.Render(new { Name = "World" }); // => "Hello World!" 
```

The language is very versatile, easy to read and use, similar to [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates:

```C#
var template = Template.Parse(@"
<ul id='products'>
  {{ for product in products }}
    <li>
      <h2>{{ product.name }}</h2>
           Price: {{ product.price }}
           {{ product.description | string.truncate 15 }}
    </li>
  {{ end }}
</ul>
");
var result = template.Render(new { Products = this.ProductList });
```

Scriban can also be used in pure scripting context without templating (`{{` and `}}`) and can help you to create your own small DSL.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Properties and methods of .NET objects are automatically exposed with lowercase and `_` names. It means that a property like `MyMethodIsNice` will be exposed as `my_method_is_nice`. This is the default convention, originally to match the behavior of liquid templates.
> If you want to change this behavior, you need to use a [`MemberRenamer`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#member-renamer) delegate

## New in 3.0+

- AST is now fully visitable with `ScriptVisitor`. You can now access `Parent` on any `ScriptNode` object and navigate the AST.
  - Improve AST round-trip by preserving whitespaces around template enter`{{` and exit`}}` 
- Several new language features:
  - Hexadecimal/binary numbers: `0x1ef` or `0b101010`
  - Support for large integers
  - [New parametric functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#72-parametric-functions): `func sub(x,y = 1, z...); ret x - y - z[0]; end`
  - [New inline functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#73-inline-functions): `sub(x,y) = x - y`
  - Optional member access with `?.` instead of regular `.` (e.g `a?.b?.c`)
  - Conditional expressions: `cond ? a : b`
- Separate language mode (via `ScriptLang` enum) from template/scripting parsing mode (`ScriptMode`).
- New language parsing mode `Scientific`, in addition to default Scriban and Liquid language mode.
- More fine-grained options on the `TemplateContext` to define scripting behaviors (`EnableRelaxedTargetAccess`, `EnableRelaxedMemberAccess`, `EnableRelaxedFunctionAccess`, `EnableRelaxedIndexerAccess`, `EnableNullIndexer`)
- New `object.eval` and `object.eval_template` function to evaluate Scriban expressions/templates at runtime.
- Better support for `IFormattable` objects.   
  
## Features

- An **extensible sandbox execution model**: You have the full control about which Scripting objects (and so properties and methods) are accessible from Scriban templates.
- Very **efficient**, **fast** parser and a **lightweight** runtime. CPU and Garbage Collector friendly.
- Powered by a Lexer/Parser providing a **full Abstract Syntax Tree, fast, versatile and robust**, more efficient than regex based parsers.
  - Precise source code location (path, column and line) for error reporting
  - **Write an AST to a script textual representation**, with [`Template.ToText`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#ast-to-text), allowing to manipulate scripts in memory and re-save them to the disk, useful for **roundtrip script update scenarios**
- **Compatible with `liquid`** by using the `Template.ParseLiquid` method
  - While the `liquid` language is less powerful than scriban, this mode allows to migrate from `liquid` to `scriban` language easily
  - With the [AST to text](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#ast-to-text) mode, you can convert a `liquid` script to a scriban script using `Template.ToText` on a template parsed with `Template.ParseLiquid`
  - As the liquid language is not strictly defined and there are in fact various versions of liquid syntax, there are restrictions while using liquid templates with scriban, see the document [liquid support in scriban](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/liquid-support.md) for more details.
- **Extensible runtime** providing many extensibility points
- Support for `async`/`await` evaluation of scripts (e.g `Template.RenderAsync`)
- [Precise control of whitespace text output](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#14-whitespace-control)
- [Full featured language](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md) including `if`/`else`/`for`/`while`, [expressions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#8-expressions) (`x = 1 + 2`), conditions... etc.
- [Function calls and pipes](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#89-function-call-expression) (`myvar | string.capitalize`)
  - [Custom functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#7-functions) directly into the language via `func` statement and allow **function pointers/delegates** via the `alias @ directive`
  - Bind [.NET custom functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#imports-functions-from-a-net-class) from the runtime API with [many options](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#the-scriptobject) for interfacing with .NET objects.
- [Complex objects](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#5-objects) (javascript/json like objects `x = {mymember: 1}`) and [arrays](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#6-arrays) (e.g `x = [1,2,3,4]`)
- Allow to pass [a block of statements](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#98-wrap-function-arg1argn--end) to a function, typically used by the `wrap` statement
- Several [built-in functions](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md):
  - [`arrays functions`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#array-functions)
  - [`date`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#date-functions)
  - [`html`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#html-functions)
  - [`maths functions`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#math-functions)
  - [`object`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#object-functions)
  - [`regex functions`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#regex-functions)
  - [`string functions`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#string-functions)
  - [`timespan`](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/builtins.md#timespan-functions)
- [Multi-line statements](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/language.md#11-code-block) without having to embrace each line by `{{...}}`
- [Safe parser](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#the-lexer-and-parser) and [safe runtime](https://github.com/scriban/scriban/blob/master/doc/runtime.md#safe-runtime), allowing you to control what objects and functions are exposed

## Syntax Coloring

You can install the [Scriban Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xoofx.scriban) to get syntax coloring for scriban scripts (without HTML) and scriban html files.

## Binaries

Scriban is available as a NuGet package: [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Scriban.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scriban/)

Compatible with the following .NET Standard 2.0+ (**New in 3.0**)

For support for older framework (.NET 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, .NET Standard 1.1, 1.3, they are only provided in older Scriban 2.x, which is no longer supported. 

Also the [Scriban.Signed](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scriban.Signed/) NuGet package provides signed assemblies.

## Source Embedding

Starting with Scriban 3.2.1+, the package comes with source included so that you can internalize your usage of Scriban into your project. This can be useful in an environment where you can't easily consume NuGet references (e.g Roslyn Source Generators).

> [!WARNING]
>  Currently, the Scriban sources are not set as readonly, so you should not modify Scriban sources in that mode as it will modify the sources for other projects using Scriban on your machine. Use this feature at your own risks!

In order to activate this feature you need to:

- Set the property `PackageScribanIncludeSource` to `true` in your project:
  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PackageScribanIncludeSource>true</PackageScribanIncludeSource>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```
- Add the `IncludeAssets="Build"` to the NuGet PackageReference for Scriban:
  ```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Scriban" Version="3.2.1" IncludeAssets="Build"/>
  </ItemGroup>
  ```

If you are targeting `netstandard2.0` or `.NET Framework 4.7.2+`, in order to compile Scriban you will need these NuGet package references (that can come from a dependency that you already have):

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.CSharp" Version="4.5.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions" Version="4.5.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this mode, all Scriban types are marked as `internal`.
>
> You should see a Scriban folder and empty subfolders in your project. This is an issue with Visual Studio 2019 16.8.x (and before) and it will be fixed in VS 2019 16.9+
